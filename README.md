Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools in the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
- It is important as it plays a crucial role in the creation of software applications and systems that assist in various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages such as C
2. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - gathering and documenting user requirements.
2. Design - creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - building the software through writing code according to the design specification.
4. Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards.
5. Deployment - releasing the software.
6. Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall uses a sequential approach with distinct phases while agile uses an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
- Waterfall is used when the customer's requirements are properly defined and no changes will be made to them while agile is used when the requirements of the customers keep changing over time hence a suitable approach.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer - writes code and implements software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer - designs and executes tests to ensure software quality.
- Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example Visual Studio while Version Control Systems(VCS) are tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing requirements - requirements may change during the development cycle. This can be solved by the use of the agile methodology which uses an iterative and incremental approach hence able to factor in the changing requirements.
- Tight deadlines - Pressure to deliver the software by a certain timeline can lead to rushed development. This can be solved by reassessing the project's timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - testing of individual components.
2. Integration testing - testing the interaction between different components.
3. System testing - testing the entire software.
4. Acceptance testing - testing the software against user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- It is the crafting of questions/ statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. This is important as it helps AI to provide clear and straightforward answers as it understands what exactly the user needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt: Tell me about cars.
- Improved prompt: What are the most popular Volkswagen models today? This is more effective as it focuses on a specific brand(Volkswagen) and focuses on the popular model.
